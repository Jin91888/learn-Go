# learn-Go

Go is a popular programming language.
Go is used to create computer programs.

package main
import ("fmt")

func main(){

fmt.Println("Hello world!") ------- fmt.Println is needed to remember

what is go ??????

cross-platform,open source programming language
can be used to create high-performance applications
a fast,statically typed,compiled language that feels like  adynamically typed,ininterpreted language

Go is a compiled language###
Go was developed at Google by Robert Griesemer,Rob Pike,and Ken Thompson in 2007
Go's syntax is similar to C++

What is Go used for????

Web development(server-side)
Developing network-based programs
Developing cross-platform enterprise applications
Cloud-native development

Why use go???
Go is fun and easy to learn
Go has fast run time and compilation time
Go supports currency
Go has memory management 
Go works on different platforms (Windows,Mac,Linux,Raspeberry Pi)

Go Compared to Python and C++
Go
Statically typed
Fast run time
Compiled 
Fast compile time
Supports concurrency through goroutines and channel
Has automatic garbage collection
Dose not support classes and objects不支持类和对象
Does not support inharitance 不支持继承

Python 
Dynamically typed
Slow run time
interpreted 
interpreted 
No Built-in concurrency mechanism没有并发机制
has classws and objects
Supports inheritance

C++
Statically typed 
Fast run time
Compiled
Slow compiled time
Supports concurrency through threads
Does not have automatic garbage collection
Has classes and objects
Supports inheritance

Notes:
编译时间的意思是指：把代码翻译成可执行的程序的时间
并发：是指在不影响最终结果的情况下，同时没有顺序地执行多项任务
静态书写：变量类型在编译时间是已知的

gonna study the basics of Go in this tutorial
It is not necessary to have any prior programming language.

Before using Go
need a text editor:VS code to write Go code.
A compiler ,Like GCC to translate the Go code into a alanguage that the computer will understand.

There are many editors and compilers to choose from.
I am gonna use an IDE 
IDE集成开发环境
